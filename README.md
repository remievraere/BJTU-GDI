# Mhardio

Mhardio is a Mario like with a very high difficulty in 2 Dimensions.

## Goal

You start as a higly wanted criminal and just escaped from your jail. The whole world is poursuing you in a 2 dimensions world split in few levels in many different place.
The purpose of this game is to reach the end of the level without dying.

## Rules

During the course of the level, a lot of obstacle will try to make you lose. Whatever is the obstacle, you'll die instantly if you can't avoid it. Let's see them :
- If you fall in a hole.
- If a rock hits you.
- If an ennemy hits you.
- If an ennemy projectile hits you.

## Gameplay

By using your keyboard, your character will move, 4 key will be used for the game : 
- Enter : Allows you to throw a projectile if you have one.
- Space : To jump on platform or over the hole, use it with right and left to jump in a specified direction.
- Arrow-left : To move your character on the left.
- Arrow-Right : To move your character on the right.

Sometimes you can find a power, which allows you to throw projectile with enter and kill enemies. Otherwise, you'll have to dodge them. But use this power precautiously, while this power is really strong (one shot enemies), you only have 3 ammo.

Care, the level is set with a lot of traps which make the game harder than ever.

## Gameworld

The design level change according to the level, each one have it's own specificity.
